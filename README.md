This is my first Go-project where I implement a simple chat server using Gorilla WebSockets. The project also contains a simple UI written 
in vanilla JS and HTML served through an Express-server. This project should have the following properties:
- basic chat server that tracks connected users and forwards messages between them
- direct/private messages between specific users
- group chats where users can send private messages only visible to members of the group
- chat commands, such as mute, kick, ban, freeze
- word censor
- user roles, such as moderator, admin, owner
- basic web-based UI that can be used to interface with the server

This list of requirements is susceptible to change.
